#  Impact of Occupational Heavy Metal Exposure on Physical Function & Fall Risk ‚Äî University at Buffalo

### Real-time Public Health Research using NHANES 2011‚Äì2016 Data

---

##  Overview

This project investigates how **occupational heavy metal exposure** affects **physical function and fall risk** among U.S. adults using the **NHANES 2011‚Äì2016** dataset.  
It applies advanced **survey-weighted regression** and **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to evaluate and predict functional impairment linked to heavy metals such as *lead, cadmium, and manganese*.

The analysis integrates **calibration methods**, **model interpretability**, and **comparative performance evaluation**, forming a reproducible pipeline for public-health analytics.

##  Objectives

- Quantify the relationship between heavy metal exposure and functional outcomes.  
- Develop predictive models to classify high-risk individuals.  
- Evaluate model calibration to ensure clinical reliability.  
- Provide insights for **public health policy** and **occupational safety measures**.

##  Models Implemented

| Model | Notebook | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | `Logistic_only.ipynb` | Baseline model for binary classification of fall risk. |
| **Random Forest (Uncalibrated)** | `Random_forest_only.ipynb` | Tree-based ensemble capturing non-linear relationships. |
| **Random Forest (Calibrated)** | `Randomforest_cal_.ipynb` | Post-calibrated model using isotonic or Platt scaling for improved probability estimates. |
| **XGBoost (Uncalibrated)** | `XGboost_only.ipynb` | Gradient-boosted decision trees optimized for tabular data. |
| **XGBoost (Calibrated)** | `XGBoost_Cal.ipynb` | Probability-calibrated version for more interpretable outputs. |

##  Methodology

1. **Data Source** ‚Äî NHANES 2011‚Äì2016 laboratory and questionnaire datasets on heavy metals, physical function, and demographics.  
2. **Data Processing** ‚Äî Merging, filtering by occupation and age group, handling survey weights.  
3. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äî Log transformation of metal concentrations, normalization, and binary outcome labeling.  
4. **Modeling** ‚Äî Implemented in Python (`statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`).  
5. **Calibration** ‚Äî Reliability plots and Brier scores to assess predictive probability quality.  
6. **Evaluation Metrics** ‚Äî Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and Calibration Curves.  
7. **Visualization** ‚Äî Matplotlib/Seaborn visual summaries for interpretability and comparison.

##  Results Summary

Key findings from the calibrated models (see `/results/` and `presentation.pptx`):

- **Calibration improved reliability** of probability predictions across all models.  
- **XGBoost with calibration** achieved the best discrimination (highest ROC-AUC).  
- **Random Forest** captured complex exposure‚Äìoutcome interactions effectively.  
- **Logistic Regression** maintained transparency and interpretability for policy applications.
